# Market Data Processor

This project implements and benchmarks different market data processing strategies with global and per-symbol throttling, targeting ultra-low latency trading systems.

---

## Overview

Each `MarketDataProcessor` implementation:

- Accepts real-time market data messages.
- Coalesces updates per symbol.
- Applies:
  - **Global rate limit**: Max N publishes per second.
  - **Per-symbol limit**: No more than 1 update per second per symbol.
- Periodically publishes the latest coalesced data for eligible symbols.

---

## Implementations

### 1. `DequeMarketDataProcessor`

- Uses standard Java data structures:
  - `ConcurrentHashMap` for symbol tracking.
  - `ConcurrentLinkedDeque` as a sliding window for global rate control.
- Periodically checks eligibility and publishes using a scheduled task.

**Pros:**
- Simple and lock-free.

**Cons:**
- Deque can grow unbounded under high load if not trimmed.

---

### 2. `BlockingQueueMarketDataProcessor`

- Similar to `DequeMarketDataProcessor`, but:
  - Replaces the Deque with a **bounded** `ArrayBlockingQueue`.

**Pros:**
- More memory-efficient due to bounded capacity.

**Cons:**
- Slightly more blocking under high throughput.

---

### 3. `LmaxDisruptorMarketDataProcessor`

- Uses [LMAX Disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor):
  - High-performance `RingBuffer` for event publishing.
  - Dedicated `EventHandler` for consuming and throttling.
- Optimized for **single producer / single consumer** low-latency pipeline.

**Pros:**
- Extremely fast and GC-friendly.

**Cons:**
- More complex to configure; requires external dependency.

---

## Benchmarks

Benchmarking is done via [JMH](https://openjdk.org/projects/code-tools/jmh/). It measures:

- **Throughput**: Events processed per second.
- **Latency**: Time taken to accept and enqueue/process a message.
- **Memory usage**: Compared across processor types (WIP).

See `benchmark/` directory for full JMH test suites.

---

## Assumptions

- `onMessage()` is always called from a single thread and will **not receive more than `MAX_GLOBAL_RATE` unique symbols per second**.
- `publishAggregatedMarketData()` or related functions like `processAndPublish`, `tryPublish` **may run in parallel** (i.e. multiple consumer threads).
- If there is **only one consumer**, some synchronization can be removed for performance gains.

---

## Known Issues

- ‚ùó `testNoDuplicateSymbolPublishWithinInterval` is **flaky**, as it depends on `Thread.sleep()` and system timing. It may fail intermittently.
- ‚ùó No cleanup mechanism for internal maps (`latestBySymbol`, `lastPublishedTime`) if symbols go stale over time.

---

## Future Improvements

- üî¨ Try `RingBufferUnsafe` in LMAX Disruptor for further latency reduction, clean up unnecessary Map and Deque synchronization.
- üíº Evaluate commercial options like [CoralSequencer](https://www.coralblocks.com/index.php/state-of-the-art-distributed-systems-with-coralmq/) if available.
- üßπ Refactor to extract reusable logic and consolidate duplicate scheduling patterns.
- üìä Improve JMH coverage:
  - Add measurements for `publishAggregatedMarketData`, `processAndPublish`, and `tryPublish`.
  - Include GC pressure and memory profiling.
